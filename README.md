# Dog_Recognition_NN
Just a collab notebook of a personal project that consists of a neural network for identifying a dog species.<p>
It consists of experimentation with 3 different networks that identify a dog species through machine learning, comparing their accuracy, precision, etc.<p>
it's assumed that the data set is stored on Google Drive.
